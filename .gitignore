# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
/public/packs
/public/packs-test
node_modules
